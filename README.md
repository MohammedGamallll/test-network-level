## Objectives
- Configure hostnames and IP addresses on two Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS) switches using the command-line interface (CLI).
- Use Cisco IOS commands to specify or limit access to the device configurations.
- Use IOS commands to save the running configuration.
- Configure two host devices with IP addresses.
- Verify connectivity between the two PC end devices.

## Scenario
As a recently hired LAN technician, your network manager has asked you to demonstrate your ability to configure a small LAN. Your tasks include configuring initial settings on two switches using the Cisco IOS and configuring IP address parameters on host devices to provide end-to-end connectivity. You are to use two switches and two hosts/PCs on a cabled and powered network.

## Instructions
### Configure the devices to fulfill the requirements below:

1. **Use a console connection to access each switch.**
2. **Name the switches:**
   - Switch1 as `Class-A`
   - Switch2 as `Class-B`
3. **Set passwords:**
   - Use `xAw6k` password for all lines.
   - Use `6EBUp` as the secret password.
4. **Encrypt all clear text passwords.**
5. **Configure a message-of-the-day (MOTD) banner.**
6. **Assign IP addresses to all devices according to the Addressing Table.**
7. **Save configurations.**
8. **Verify connectivity between all devices.**
